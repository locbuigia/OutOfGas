# OutOfGas

This program implements the Google maps api to create a map for the user to view. It provides users a registration activity 
that requests their email to verify the account. After that they are free to log into the app freely. Should they forget their 
password, there is a way to get it using their email. 

Use Cases:
Register - Users can register with their emails.
Log In - If a user has an existing account, then they are able to log in once they've provided their username and password.
Forgot Password - If a user has forgotton their password, then by providing their username and email they can get it back.
